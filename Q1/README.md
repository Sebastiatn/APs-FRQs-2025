Question 1 Analysis
Dog Walker
This section contains my analysis of Question 1 (Methods and Control Structures):

My initial approach during the exam:
 - My initial approach was trying to figure out what the question was asking and reading the instruction to see what I need to do for the code
 - Then I would make a checklist of what I would need to do in my head
 - Then I would mentally plan out a path that the code would follow and see if it works
My revised solution after review:
 - My revised solution after review was just not to think too much
 - Code with the flow and finish the code
 - Review the code to see if there's any errors
 - Then I do some finally checking to see if it works
Key concepts tested in this question:
- Dont over think
- Remember how to do or statments and how to use for loops
What I learned from revisiting this problem:
- How to use something like "company.numAvaiableDogs(hour)"
